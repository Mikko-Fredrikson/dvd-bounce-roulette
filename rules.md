# Project Rules

## Development Rules

1. **Code Quality**: Follow best practices for clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
2. **Testing**: Each feature should have unit tests written for them before the feature is developed further
3. **Task Workflow**: Only work on one task at a time. First, define each task in the task list under the correct category. Then, write unit tests for that feature. Once the feature works, mark the task as done.

## DVD Bounce Roulette Game Rules

1. **Play Area**: The game is played in a square-shaped area.
2. **Name Placement**: Participant names are displayed along the perimeter of the square.
3. **Name Rotation**: Names rotate counter-clockwise around the perimeter at a constant speed.
4. **DVD Logo**: A DVD logo bounces around the play area, changing direction when it hits any edge.
5. **Color Change**: The DVD logo changes color each time it bounces off a boundary.
6. **Name Elimination**: When the DVD logo touches/collides with a name, that name is eliminated from the game.
7. **Game Progress**: As names are eliminated, they are removed from the rotation around the perimeter.
8. **Winning Condition**: The last name remaining is the winner.
9. **Game Reset**: The game can be reset at any time to start with a new set of names.
